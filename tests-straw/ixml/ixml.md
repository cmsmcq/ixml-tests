# Tests for the ixml grammar for ixml

This directory contains contains an automatically generated set of positive test cases for 
the invisible-XML grammar of invisible XML.  Material here includes:

* The ixml grammar for ixml (in [ixml](ixml.ixml), in [XML](ixml.xml)). 

* A [test catalog](ixml.test-catalog.pos.xml) containing nine positive tests for the grammar

* A manually constructed regular superset of the ixml grammar for ixml (in [ixml](ixml.O0.ixml), in [XML](ixml.O0.ixml.xml)).   (This was intended to help generate negative test cases, but problems arose.)
