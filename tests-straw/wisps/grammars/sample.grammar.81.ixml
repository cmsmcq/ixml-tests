{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), p. 261 (2e).  (Does not
appear in 1e, that I know of.)

Appears as problem 8.6.  Sec. 8.2.5.1 showed that no left-recursive
grammar can be LL(1) because of FIRST/FIRST conflict.  "But what about
the grammar [below] [p. 261] which is left-recursive, obviously not
LL(1), but the FIRST sets of both alternatives contains only
&epsilon;?"  }
