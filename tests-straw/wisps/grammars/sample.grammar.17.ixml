{ Sample grammar 17, from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), p. 217 (2e).  (Not
present in 1e.)

This is from their discussion of epsilon rules in Earley parsing (and
in particular the Aycock/Horspool modification).

This should exercise some bugs in the calculation of new items.  This
is shorter than sample grammar 2.  (At test case golf, Grune and
Jacobs win!)
