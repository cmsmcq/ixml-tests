{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 89 (1e) and 112 (2e).

They use this grammar to illustrate CYK parsing.
"This grammar describes the syntax of numbers in scientific notation."

Versions of this grammar after elimination of epsilon-rules, 
after eliminating unit rules, and after further cleanup (elimination
of unreachable non-terminals) are given in pp. 120-122 of 2e.  I
have not made test cases from them.  A Chomsky Normal Form equivalent
is sample grammar 54.
