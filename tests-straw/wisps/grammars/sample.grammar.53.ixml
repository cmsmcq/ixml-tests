{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 96 (1e) and 120 (2e).

They use this grammar to illustrate grammar cleaning (in the course
of their discussion of CYK parsing); this is the result of applying
their epsilon-rule elimination scheme to sample grammar 52.

Its interest here is that it is an example of a machine-generated
grammar and that it has non-productive and/or unreachable non-terminals.
(Cleaning the grammar reduces it to the rule S: "a".)
