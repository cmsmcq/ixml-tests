A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on p. 9 of the PDF, between examples 12 and 13.

"A variant of the grammar above [sc. sample grammar 68] is the

unambiguous: ...  As we shall see in Section 8, this grammar is
closely related to grammars occurring naturally in biosequence
analysis."
