{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 169 (1e) and 240 (2e).

"The grammar describes a simple language that could be used as the 
input language for a rudimentary consulting system; the user enters
some facts, and then asks a question.  There is also a facility for
sub-sesssions.  The contents of the facts and questions are of no
concern here.  They are represented by the word STRING, which is
regarded as a terminal symbol."

I've simulated STRING by defining it as a line of characters
ending with newline.
