S: X, X.
X: a.
X: .

{ The language is {'', 'a', 'aa'}.
  When we parse the first one, we accrue items thus:
  1 (0, 0, S -> . X X) by initialization
  2 (0, 0, X -> . a) by prediction from 1.
  3 (0, 0, X -> .) by prediction from 1.
  4 (0, 0, S -> X . X) by completion from 3, with 1.
  5 (0, 0, S -> X X .) by completion from 3, with 4.
 
  We have thus established that the predictor items
  needed for completion are not necessarily present
  when the completing item is added to the set.  Here
  item 4 cannot be added until after 3, because it depends
  on 3.
