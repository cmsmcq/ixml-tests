{ Sample grammar 15, from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 155 (1e) and 212 (2e).

This grammar appears in their discussion of space and time
requirements for Earley parsing.  It illustrates the kind of grammar
"in which almost all non-terminal produce almost all substrings in
almost all combinatorially possible ways, as for example in the
grammar S -> SS, S -> x."

  as for example: 1e as for instance
