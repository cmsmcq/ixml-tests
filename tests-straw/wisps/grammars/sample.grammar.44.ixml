{ Sample grammar from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
Second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 34 (1e) and 26 (2e).

Rules for ws added for convenience; Grune and Jacobs assume the lexer
eats whitespace. Peculiarity:  whitespace is allowed but not required,
and it is allowed after any word but not at the beginning of the input.
