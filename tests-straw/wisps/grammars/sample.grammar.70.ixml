The PDF gives no indication of publication venue.  The citation given

A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on p. 9 of the PDF as Example 13.

"... tiny ambiguous grammar representing simple arithmetical expressions"
(p. 9 of PDF).

They later give an unambiguous equivalent, which is essentially
the same as sample grammars 37 and 49 (and thus omitted).
