{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 95 (1e) and 120 (2e).

They use this grammar to illustrate grammar cleaning (in the course
of their discussion of CYK parsing).

"The grammar of Figure 4.10 [4.8 in 1e] is a nasty grammar to text
your &epsilon;-rule elimination scheme on."
