{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 99 (1e) and 123 (2e).

This is a Chomsky Normal Form version of sample grammar 51; its
primary interest for testing ixml parsers is its opacity.
