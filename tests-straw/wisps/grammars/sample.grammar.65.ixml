{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 181 (1e) and 255 (2e).

This is an LL(k+1) grammar that is not LL(k), where k = 3.
The language itself, however, is not LL(4):  the same language is
defined by S: "a","a","a", ("b";"c").
