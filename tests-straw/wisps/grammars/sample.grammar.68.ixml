A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on p. 9 of the PDF, as example 12.

"A classical example of an unambiguous grammar that is not LR(k) (nor
LR-Regular) is the following, called Pal, whose language consists of
