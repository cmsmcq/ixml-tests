{ Sample grammar 16, from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 159 (1e) and 216 (2e).

From their discussion of epsilon rules in Earley parsing.  This
illustrates the kind of grammar which exercises bugs in the closure
algorithm / in the sequencing of the handling of states.  This results
from the ability to omit the explicit multiplication operator, so
"a*a" can also be represented "aa".
