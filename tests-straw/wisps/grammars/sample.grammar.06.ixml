{ Sample grammar 6, derived from 5 to demonstrate that infinite
numbers of parse trees can arise without empty RHS.  (I understand
Loup Vaillant to be saying otherwise at

  http://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing/parser

but I may have misunderstood or read carelessly.  The problem arises
whenever the u v^n w x^n y of the pumping lemma has v and x nillable
or (as here) null.)
