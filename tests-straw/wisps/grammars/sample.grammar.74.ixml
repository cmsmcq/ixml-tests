A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on page 19 of the PDF as grammar G1 in Figure 2,
exhibiting "good ambiguity"; it also appears p. 20 as grammar G1 in
Figure 3 exhibiting "bad ambiguity".

It is "an ambiguous grammar (G1 from Reeder et al. [30])".

Apparently multiply ambiguous, some ambiguities "good" and others "bad".
