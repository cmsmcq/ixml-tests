A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on page 6 of the PDF as Example 4 (Vertical ambiguity).

"Intuitively, vertical unambiguity means that, during parsing of a
string, there is never a choice between two different productions of a
non-terminal." (p. 5).

"The string xay can be parsed in two ways by choosing either the first
or the second production of Z, that is, xay &isin; L_G(A "y")
&intersect; L_G("x" B).  The name *vertical* ambiguity comes from the
fact that productions are often written as separate lines as in this
example." (p. 6)
