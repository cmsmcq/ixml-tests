A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on page 6 of the PDF as Example 5 (Horizontal ambiguity).

"Horizontal unambiguity then means that, when parsing a string
according to a production, there is never any choice of how to split
the string into substrings corresponding to the entities in the
production." (p. 5).

"Also here, the string xay can be parsed in two ways, by parsing the a
either in "x" A (using the first production of A and the second of B)
or in B (using the second production of A and the first of B). More
formally, xay âˆˆ L_G("x" A) &language-overlap; L_G(B). Here, the
ambiguity is at a split-point between entities on the right-hand side
of a particular production, hence the name horizontal ambiguity." (p. 6)
