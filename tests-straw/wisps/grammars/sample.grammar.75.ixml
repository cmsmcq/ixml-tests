A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on page 21 of the PDF as Example 23 (Voss-Light).

"The grammar Voss from Voss et al. [36] has 28 nonterminals and 65
productions.  This grammar clearly asks for automatic support (even
for experts in formal grammars).  ...  First, we study a grammar,
Voss-Light, which demonstrates an essential aspect of the Voss
grammar: unpaired bases in bulges and loops (the dots in the
transformed grammar) must be treated differently, and they hence are
derived from different nonterminal symbols even though they recognize
the same language."
