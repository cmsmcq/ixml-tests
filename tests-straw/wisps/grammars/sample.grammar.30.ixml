{ Sample grammar 30.  Cut down from 3. 

  An attempt to isolate the bug caused by the initial version
  of sample.grammar.03 (toy CSS grammar).
 
  (Plan:  Play code golf.  Start with 03, cut the grammar
  down as long as we can while retaining the bug.)

{ Revisions:
  2019-04-15 : CMSMcQ : make ixml version (from teststrings.xml)
  2018-04-07 : CMSMcQ : made this by cutting down 3

name: ["a"-"z"]; ["a"-"z"].
