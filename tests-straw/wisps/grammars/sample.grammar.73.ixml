A paper with the same authors and title (but apparently slightly
different text) appeared in International Conference on Implementation
and Application of Automata CIAA 2007, ed. Jan Holub, Jan
&Zhacek;d'&aacute;rek (Springer), LNCS 4783, pp. 214-225.

This grammar appears on page 18 of the PDF, as Example 22.

This grammar illustrates the property of RNA
palindromes that a given letter matches not itself but a
complementary base.  (I am confused by G/U as well as G/C
and A/U, but perhaps by "complementary" here they means a base
matches any base but itself.)
