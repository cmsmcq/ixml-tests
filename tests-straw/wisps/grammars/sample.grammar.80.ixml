{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), p. 260 (2e).  (Does not
appear in 1e, that I know of.)

Appears as problem 8.5.c.  "Is the following grammar LL(1)?"

S:  A.
A: "a", A.

I'd have to review the definition. }
