{ Sample grammar 27.

  Another grammar with infinite ambiguity. This one shows
  that the problem of multiple non-trivial paths does not arise
  only horizontally with regular-right-part grammars, but can be
  created vertically as well; the set of derivations is the same
  as the set of paths through the right-hand side of S in
  sample.grammar.25.
