  2019-04-15 : CMSMcQ : restore right brace to Vaillant's first rule for Block,
                        since syntax of 2019-01-28 allows comments to next.
                        this was (again) caught by the (new) DCG parser.
  2018-08-10 : CMSMcQ : correct syntax error caught by DCG parser.
  2018-03-29 : CMSMcQ : copied from net, translated into ixml
