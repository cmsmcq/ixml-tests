{ Sample grammar 31.  Cut down from 3. 

  An attempt to isolate the bug caused by the initial version
  of sample.grammar.03 (toy CSS grammar).
 
  Like 30, but the two branches are not identical.
}

{ Revisions:
  2019-04-15 : CMSMcQ : make ixml version (from teststrings.xml)
  2018-04-07 : CMSMcQ : made this by cutting down 3
}

name: ["a"-"z"]; ["a"-"z";"A"-"Z"].
