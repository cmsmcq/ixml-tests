{ Sample grammar adapted from Dick Grune and Ceriel J. H. Jacobs,
Parsing techniques: A practical guide (New York: Ellis Horwood, 1990;
second edition New York:  Springer, 2008), pp. 170 (1e) and 242 (2e).

This is my rewrite of sample 63, using * instead of recursion in
the definition of Facts.  (Session could also be

    Session:  (Fact)*, Question; "(", Session, ")", Session.
    
but I believe this version is a little clearer.

{ Revisions:
  2018-08-10 : CMSMcQ : correct syntax error found by DCG parser
  2018-08-10 : CMSMcQ : made first transcription.
}

Session:  Facts, Question; "(", Session, ")", Session.
Facts: (Fact)*.
Fact: "!", STRING.
Question: "?", STRING.

STRING: (~[#0A])*, [#0A].

{ This and sample grammar 62 are rewrites of grammar 62. }
