<grammar-pipeline>
  
  <desc>
    <p>This pipeline takes an ixml grammar and produces an O_0
    superset grammar, in the form of a stack-augmented pseudo-regular
    grammar showing the recursive transition network for the input
    grammar.</p>
    
    <p>I'm not completely sure I know what I'm doing; I know I did
    this before, but I need a better way to remember how to do it.
    That's this pipeline, maybe.</p>
	
    <p>Revisions:
    2022-02-19 : CMSMcQ : borrow this from O0-superset.xsl, extend
                          to insert labels
    2021-01-10 : CMSMcQ : incorporate in a stand-alone stylesheet
    2020-12-30 : CMSMcQ : began pipeline.

      <p>Applied to a recursive transition network
      this is said to eliminate epsilon transitions.
      Does it retain stack info?
