# Tests for various very small grammars

This directory contains contains a collection of tests for a set of very small
invisible-XML grammars.  Material here includes:

* Grammar g010 (generates empty string):  [ixml](g010.ixml), [XML](g010.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g010.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g010.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g010](g010.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated 

* Grammar g011 (generates sequences of 'a' characters):  [ixml](g011.ixml), [XML](g011.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g011.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g011.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g011](g011.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated 

* Grammar g012 (generates strings of non-blank, non-C0 XML characters):  [ixml](g012.ixml), [XML](g012.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g012.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g012.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g012](g012.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated 

* Grammar g022 (generates strings of alternating 'a' and 'b'):  [ixml](g022.ixml), [XML](g022.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g022.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g022.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g022](g022.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated 

* Grammar g101 (generates no strings:  grammar is unsatisfiable):  [ixml](g101.ixml), [XML](g101.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g101.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g101.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g101](g101.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated 

* Grammar g102 (unsatisfiable, generates no strings):  [ixml](g102.ixml), [XML](g102.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g102.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g102.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g102](g102.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated 

* Grammar g112 (generates non-empty strings of the letter 'a'):  [ixml](g112.ixml), [XML](g112.ixml.xml), [positive tests](g112.test-catalog.xml), [negative tests](g112.O3.test-catalog.all.neg.xml) and the [regular superset O3 of grammar g112](g112.O3.ixml.xml) from which they were generated
