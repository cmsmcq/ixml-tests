	<head>Introduction</head>
	<p>This document lists the elements in an XML vocabulary for
	ixml test catalogs and test-result reports, giving a short
	description of each.  Fuller description and discussion
	may be added later if felt to be needed; for now this is
	mostly an alphabetical reference list to explain what the
	elements are intended to mean and how they are to be used.</p>
	<p>The vocabulary described was developed by C. M. Sperberg-McQueen
	as a proposal for the invisible-XML Community Group at the
	World Wide Web Consortium, but it has not yet been considered
	by the group, still less adopted, and it has no official status
	of any kind.</p>
	<p>The vocabulary describes two different types of document:
	<list>
	  <item>
	    <p>Test catalogs describe a potentially complex set of
	    test cases for an invisible XML processor; they can
	    be organized internally into multiple sets of test cases,
	    and test sets can nest.</p>
	    <p>Each test set may specify an ixml grammar in either
	    ixml or XML form, together with a set of test cases and
	    optionally nested test sets.  An optional
	    <gi>grammar-test</gi> element signals that the grammar
	    itself should be regarded as a test case and identifies
	    the expected result of processing the grammar.</p>
	    <p>Each test case in a test set supplies input to be
	    parsed against the grammar for the test set, and
	    specifies a result.</p>
	    <p>Grammars and test-case input can be given inline
	    or in separate files.  The expected results can also
	    be given inline or externally.</p>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <p>Test reports describe the results of running a
	    given processor against the tests in a test catalog.</p>
	    <p>A metadata section provides information about the
	    test catalog used and the processor tested.  Then,
	    for each test set and test case, the result produced
	    by the processor is reported and whether it is or is not
	    the result expected in the test catalog.</p>
	    <p><hi>Note:  the current version of this vocabulary
	    does not yet define elements for test reports.  Real
	    soon now.</hi></p>
	  </item>
	</list></p>
	<p>A <ref target="catalog-sketch.xml">sample test
	catalog</ref> is given in the <code>doc</code> directory of
	the ixml-tests Git repository (where this document is also to
	be found) in both <ref target="catalog-sketch.xml">XML</ref>
	and <ref target="catalog-sketch.html">HTML</ref> (for
	situations where dynamic XSLT processing is not possible).
	</p>
      </div>
      
      <div xml:id="issues">
	<head>Known issues</head>
	<p>Among the shortcomings of the current state of the
	test catalog schema are these.</p>
	<p xml:id="reports"><label>No reporting of test
	results.</label> XML vocabularies are needed to allow a test
	harness to report the detailed results of running a test suite
	and comparing the output to the expected results, and to allow
	the developers of an implementation to report (perhaps in
	somewhat less detail) which tests they have run and not run,
	and of those they ran which tests they passed and which they
	failed.</p>
	<p>An initial sketch of such a vocabulary is expected
	soon, but it's not here yet.</p>
	<p xml:id="ambiguity"><label>Awkward treatment of ambiguous
	sentences.</label> An ambiguous sentence has more than one
	parse tree, and the choice of which tree to return is
	implementation-dependent (or possibly implementation-defined),
	so that a correct implementation may easily produce a parse
	tree which is correct but does not match the parse tree
	specified in the test case.</p>
	
	<p>The current approach is to allow multiple parse trees, with
	the meaning being that if the processor produces any of them,
	it passes that test.  If the processor returns a parse forest
	instead of a single tree, every tree in the returned forest
	should be among those specified in the result.  This has the
	drawback that in some cases the set of parse trees specified
	will not be and cannot be complete: in some grammars, some
	sentences have an infinite number of parse trees.</p>
	<p>For practical purposes, however, we can expect there to be
	a finite number of processors using any given test suite, each
	of which will return a finite number of trees.  If a processor
	fails a test on an ambiguous grammar, then the tree returned
	by the processor should be checked manually and added to the
	specified result.  Unless a processor returns a different
	result each time it parses the test input, the second and
	later runs against the test suite should be problem-free.</p>
	<p>There are of course alternatives:
	<list>
	  <item>
	    <p>Allow an assertion about the result, expressed in
	    XPath.  This is the approach taken in the QT test suite
	    and in XSpec. Drawback: unless the assertion is very
	    thorough, the test case will not fully specify the
	    required test result, allowing incorrect results to pass
	    the test.</p>
	  </item>
	  <item>
	    <p>Allow a set of assertions about the result, expressed
	    in XPath.  To pass the test, a processor's result must
	    satisfy all assertions.  Drawback: as before, though it's
	    easier to be thorough.</p> 
	  </item>	  
	  <item>
	    <p>Allow an and/or tree of assertions about the result,
	    expressed in XPath.  To pass the test, a processor's
	    result must satisfy all children of an <gi>and</gi> and at
	    least one child of an <gi>or</gi>.  Drawback: logical
	    conjunction and disjunction are already built in to XPath
	    so it's not really necessary to provide a new set of
	    machinery for the purpose.</p>
	  </item>
	</list>
	As the examples of the QT3 test suite and XSpec show, all of
	these involve building additional machinery both into the
	vocabulary for the test catalog and also into the test
	harness.  An XPath assertion must be evaluated in a dynamic
	context and must say something about the result returned, so
	we now end up having to build a dynamic context and bind the
	result to some well known variable like <code>$result</code>,
	so that the assertion can say something useful about the
	result.</p>
	<p>The current approach has the comparative advantage
	that it does not require an XPath evaluator: one could in
	principle handle the comparison of test results to the
	expected output by writing out temporary files and calling a
	diff program.  The occasional false negative in the test
	results seems a small price to pay for that advantage.

	    problems in an ixml parser, so it may be thought
	    useful to record the raw parse tree, even though
	    there is no standard place for it in the schema.
	    The following example shows a raw parse tree

	  <remarks>
	    <p>When a suite of related tests is published, it may
	    happen that there are different test-catalog files (and
	    <gi>test-catalog</gi> elements) for different groups of
	    tests within the larger collection.  It is a good idea for
	    there to be one test catalog that includes all of the
	    others, so as to provide a single point of entry for
	    processing the entire collection of tests.  The
	    <gi>test-set-ref</gi> element is used to include other
	    test-catalog files.</p>

	    </attDef>
	  </attList>
	  <remarks>
	    <p>The grammar for a test set may be given in any of
	    several ways:
	    <list>
	      <item>
		<p>in ixml form inline, using an <gi>ixml-grammar</gi>
		element, or</p>
	      </item>
	      <item>		
		<p>in ixml form in an external resource, using an
		<gi>ixml-grammar-ref</gi> element, or</p>
	      </item>
	      <item>
		<p>in XML form inline, using the <gi>vxml-grammar</gi>
		element, or</p>
	      </item>
	      <item>
		<p>in XML form in an external resource, using the
		<gi>vxml-grammar-ref</gi> element.</p>
	      </item>
	    </list>
	    Here, <mentioned>vxml</mentioned> is short for
	    <gloss>visible XML</gloss>, as distinct from
	    <gloss>invisible XML</gloss>.</p>
	    
	    <p>The <gi>grammar-test</gi> element can be used to
	    specify that the grammar itself is to be treated as a test
	    case and parsed or checked against the grammar for ixml
	    grammars.  In this case, the test set need not contain any
	    test cases.</p>
	    
	    <p>Test sets can be nested to reflect any desired
	    structure for the test suite.  Nested test sets can take
	    the form of child <gi>test-set</gi> elements or of child
	    <gi>test-set-ref</gi> elements, which give the URI of a
	    subordinate test set.  (In practice the test set reference
	    is usually to an XML document rooted in
	    <gi>test-catalog</gi>, rather than <gi>test-set</gi>, but
	    the effect is the same: all test sets in the external
	    resource are logically subordinate to the parent of the
	    <gi>test-set-ref</gi> element.)</p>
	    <p>If a grammar is specified by a <gi>test-set</gi>
	    element or by one of its ancestor <gi>test-set</gi>
	    elements, then the test set can contain any number of test
	    cases.  A grammar specified on a descendant overrides any
	    grammar specified on an ancestor; the first grammar found,
	    when ascending from the test case, is the one used.</p>
	    <p>Note that grammars are not inherited across references
	    to external test sets.</p>
