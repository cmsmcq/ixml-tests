# ixml-tests
Test suite(s) for ixml

This project contains collections of tests for invisible XML, together
with supporting materials.  For more on invisible XML, see
https://invisiblexml.org and material linked from there.

The subdirectory organization is fairly simple:

* The A (admin) directory contains work plans and similar stuff.

* The doc directory contains documentation and technical papers.

* The lib directory contains schemas and other ancillary materials.

* The tests-straw directory contains a proof-of-concept test suite for
ixml parsing functionality, with catalog and test cases and results
(some as separate files, some in the catalog).  

Further test suites may be added later in further tests-* directories.

For now, the default license is GPL 3.0, though I am not sure whether
that actually makes sense for test cases; other license terms may be
available.
