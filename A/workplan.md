# Work plan for ixml-tests

2021-01-25

Current goal is to have a proof-of-concept test suite in place here in the next couple of days.

I have spent a couple of hours reviewing the schemas for the XSD and QT3 (XSLT/XQuery/XPath 3.0 and 3.1) test suites.  Next steps:

* Sketch an example of a test catalog.

* Sketch a schema for the test catalog.

* Modify Gingersnap to produce its test cases in the form specified for the catalog.

* Populate the tests-straw directory.
